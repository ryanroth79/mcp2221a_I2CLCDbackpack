# mcp2221a_Ic2LCDbackpack

This project connects to an LCD containing the "LCD Backpack" through the MCP2221A and prints a simple message. It uses the "hidapi" from the fine folks who put together LibUSB.

See: https://github.com/libusb/hidapi

The LCD backpack is built around an NXP PCF8754T I2C "bus expander". The connection uses the "4-bit" mode of the HD44780 series chip originally by Hitachi.

:) Hope this helps.
